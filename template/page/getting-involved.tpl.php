    <p>Getting involved with the Apache OFBiz Community is <strong>easy!</strong></p>
    <p>Apache OFBiz is an open source community project governed by rules and <a href="//apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html" target="external">Code of Conduct</a> of <a href="//apache.org/" target="external">the Apache Software Foundation.</a> All Apache projects value key concepts such as community, consensus, openness and transparency.</p>
    <p>A popular Apache mantra is <strong>"Community over Code"</strong> meaning that being able to work and collaborate as a community is more important than producing code</p>
    <p>The Apache OFBiz source code is free, open source and provided under the <a href="//apache.org/licenses/">Apache Licence.</a> It is also easily accessible from the Apache source code repository. The project mailing lists contain all project releated discussions and decisions. </p>

So you see there are quite a few ways that non developers can help and contribute to improving OFBiz. </p>
